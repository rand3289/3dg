# 3dg #
3dg is a tiny 3D graph visualization program to be used with anaglyph (red/blue) glasses.  It is written in C++ using Simple Directmedia Layer library.  Runs on linux and anything else that supports SDL.  You can rotate the graph around 2 axis by pressing arrow keys.  Escape or "q" quits.  Enter controls fullscreen or windowed mode.  Current version is under 300 lines of code and displays a random graph only.


#### TODO ####
* Current screen projection function is a hack and therefore zoom is broken
* Add suport for DOT files https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_(graph_description_language)
