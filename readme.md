# 3dg #
3dg is a tiny 3D graph visualization program to be used with anaglyph (red/blue) glasses.  It is written in C++ using Simple Directmedia Layer library.  Runs on linux and most likely on anything else that supports SDL.  You can rotate the graph around 2 axis by pressing arrow keys.  Escape or q-quits.  Enter controls fullscreen or windowed mode.  Current version is 291 lines of code and displays a random graph only. It displays graph node labels.

Future versions will display graphs stored in a dot file if you pass one on the command line.
