# 3dg
3dg is a tiny 3D graph visualization program to be used with anaglyph (red/blue) glasses written using Simple Directmedia Layer library.  Runs on linux and most likely on anything else that supports SDL. Written in C++.  Current version displays a random graph only.  You can rotate the graph around 2 axis by pressing arrow keys.  Escape or q-quits.

Future versions will display graphs stored in a dot file format if you pass one on the command line

It supports graph node labels.
Current projection is a hack and zoom in/out does not work.
